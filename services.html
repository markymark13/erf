                                <p>Elizabeth created beautiful floral arrangements for my daughter's wedding on 7/22. She was so flexible when we changed our mind about what we wanted. She arrived a couple of hours before the ceremony and created the arbor arrangements on site. We were very happy to work with Elizabeth and thrilled with the beautiful flowers. Thank you!</p>
