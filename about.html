                    <h2>Hello there!</h2>
                    <hr class="line line-hr-left">
                    <h5> My name is Elizabeth and I am the founder, owner, and lead designer of Elizabeth Rose Florals.</h5>
                    <p>I officially created Elizabeth Rose Florals in early 2023 but my passion for gardening and flowers started in my childhood. Fond memories of working in my mother's garden inspired my lifelong interest in floral design.</p>
                    <p>As an adult, I built a strong career in corporate high tech and various large organizations, but I longed for a career that allowed me to greatly channel and express my artistic creativity. After several years of gardening and creating florals for family and friends while simultaneously earning a Masters of Arts in Counseling, I decided to fuse my knowledge of flowers with my passion for working with people by starting Elizabeth Rose Florals.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy spending time listening to each client to get a real sense of the vibe they are going for so that I can bring their vision to fruition. Having worked with many established florists, I have a deep appreciation for the artistry that goes behind creating harmonious designs and how flowers set the tone and enhance events. I carry this appreciation into every one of my projects no matter how big or small.</p>
                    <p>I have always loved spending time in nature and I incorporate sustainable practices by recycling and using eco conscious products (no floral foam) as much as possible. I source locally-grown, in season flowers to the fullest extent. This approach supports the local economy and has an added benefit to clients. When local flowers are in bloom in the years to follow, clients are reminded of their special day. My love of nature extends to animals and I incorporate this passion by donating arrangements to The Wild Animal Sanctuary.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for considering Elizabeth Rose Florals for your floral endeavors and happy flowering!</p>
                    <p></p>

                                <p>I am blown away by how perfectly Elizabeth executed my exact wishes!! She was able to put my vision together long distance, as I live in Indiana and I was planning my wedding for Colorado. No only did she knock these flowers out of the park, but she DELIVERED them to my Airbnb while I was getting ready. All of my flowers were locally grown, which blew me away. She also delivered them with vases and stabilizing boxes for travel, since I had a drive to Rocky Mountain National Park. Elizabeth will take care of you!</p>

                                <p>Elizabeth not only created the exact floral vision I was hoping for, but she was such a joy to work with! She left no detail on and made sure my flowers were exactly in line with the vision I originally spoke with her about. I had some pretty unique colors in there, but she still pulled it off! Her team was flexible and extremely helpful the day of the wedding - I couldnâ€™t imagine having anybody else arrange our flowers</p>
