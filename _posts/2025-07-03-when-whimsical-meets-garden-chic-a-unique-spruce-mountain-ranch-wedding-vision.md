Set against the backdrop of [Spruce Mountain Ranch](https://sprucemountainevents.com/) in Larkspur, Colorado, K and C’s wedding was a true celebration of love, whimsy and individuality. Their vision was a fresh, unique twist on floral tradition, blending the charm of “just-picked-from-the-garden” feel with a playful, Dr. Seuss-inspired flair. The color palette of lilac, chartreuse, and whites brought a lively and delicate harmony to the overall aesthetic.  Every floral detail—from the bride’s bouquet to the reception centerpieces—was thoughtfully curated to create an eclectic yet cohesive look, tying together the entire event with the beauty and charm of nature.

**The Bridal Bouquet: Whimsical and Unique**

The bridal bouquet was a stunning composition of eclectic, carefully curated blooms. A standout feature was the inclusion of Calla Lilies—an elegant flower deeply significant to the bride—infusing personal meaning into the floral artistry. The bride requested all-Calla Lily bouquets for her bridesmaids, and we were honored to bring that vision to life. These cohesive, elegant arrangements created a unified line of floral beauty, perfectly complementing the bride’s bouquet and the varied, yet harmonized, bridesmaid dresses.

The bridal bouquet set the tone for the day—crafted entirely of white roses and baby's breath. Designed to feel both delicate and traditional, it complemented the softness of E's gown and reflected the romantic atmosphere of the day. Without greenery or added color, it let texture take the lead: the cloud-like clusters of baby's breath danced around the smooth, luminous petals of the roses, creating a bouquet that felt both timeless and ethereal.

#### **Ceremony: Whimsical Florals**

The ground arbor lovingly embraced the couple, surrounding them in a cascade of florals—delicate larkspur and allium mingling effortlessly with whimsical, Dr. Seuss-inspired blooms that twisted and curled in playful, unexpected shapes. At the bride’s request, lush moss was thoughtfully incorporated, artfully nestled within the garden-inspired ground arbor to enhance the organic charm of the ceremony space.

**Reception: Where Whimsy Meets Elegance**

That same natural, whimsical energy carried into the reception. Moss was woven into the centerpieces alongside vintage-style lamps selected and rented by the bride through Dizzy and Co., creating a cohesive and eclectic look. These intentionally chosen elements forged a seamless connection between ceremony and celebration, complemented by florals that felt uniquely whimsical, lighthearted, and undeniably elegant.

The result was an unforgettable **Spruce Mountain Ranch wedding**—a perfect reflection of the couple’s one-of-a-kind love story and distinct creative vision.

The head table was a delightful display of hand-selected whimsical bud vases, each paired with light, airy florals that enhanced the fresh, garden-inspired atmosphere. Softly glowing taper candles and vintage-inspired lamps—carefully chosen by the bride—added warmth and charm, creating an eclectic yet cohesive tablescape that felt both intimate and enchanting.

#### **A Note on Design Philosophy**

Floral design, to us, is more than arrangement—it’s artful storytelling, where every bloom plays a role. With K & C’s wedding, we were honored to bring that story to life, with care, curiosity and creativity.
