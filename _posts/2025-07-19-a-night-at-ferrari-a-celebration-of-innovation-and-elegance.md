Ferrari’s exclusive holiday event in Highlands Ranch was a masterclass in luxury and precision, where cutting-edge design met timeless Italian craftsmanship. The evening unfolded like a symphony with an immersive experience framed by sleek and modern floral arrangements that echoed Ferrari’s iconic red.

The client’s vision was clear: bold, elegant, and unmistakably Ferrari. Our floral design told a story of passion and innovation, combining deep red roses, anthurium, and accents of glossy red tones to emulate the exquisite Ferrari models. The goal was to transform Ferrari’s legendary location into a refined space that honored the brand’s legacy.

**Floral Centerpieces: Luxury Meets Modern Elegance**

Each table centerpiece were bold statements of crimson and dark red roses mixed with a variety of dramatic red florals. The designs were sculptural which mirrored Ferrari’s blend of art and engineering. The floral silhouettes played off the gleaming curves of the cars on display, creating a cohesive atmosphere that felt both luxurious and dynamic.

Interspersed candles flickered softly, adding warmth and drama to the setting. The centerpieces were not only a visual focal point but a reflection of Ferrari’s signature blend of power and elegance.

**Lounge Florals: Refined Drama in Every Detail**

  
Strategically placed throughout the lounge areas, these arrangements brought an intimate, refined touch to the space. Designed to complement the centerpieces, the florals featured the same rich crimson palette of deep red roses and modern, textured blooms arranged with effortless sophistication. These were quiet moments of drama with an intentional design detail that deepened the event’s immersive luxury.
