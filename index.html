                                <p>Elizabeth was our hero! First off, the florals were perfect - everything we envisioned, except better than we imagined. Elizabeth listened to everything we had to say and put together arrangements that pulled our entire wedding visual together - from the general color palette and overall shape/design/flow to the textures and flower choices, she nailed every detail. Second, she was super responsive and helpful throughout the whole planning process and we loved having her as an expert and partner. She really listened to our needs, worked with our budget and custom requests, and answered all our annoying questions. Third, she and her team went above and beyond on the wedding day to make sure everything went seamlessly. Elizabeth is a genuine, kind person that was a pleasure to have on our vendor dream team during the hectic day. If you're lucky enough to be having your wedding in Colorado, HIRE ELIZABETH ROSE FLORALS!

                                <p>Elizabeth did an AMAZING job bringing my wedding floral vision to life. My bouquet was gorgeous and exactly what I envisioned. Elizabeth even came to my home to pick up a special bouquet wrap and measure my dogs neck for her floral collar. Elizabeth was so easy and pleasant to work with and so fast to respond to any questions I had. I would recommend Elizabeth to anyone!!</p>
