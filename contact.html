                                <p>I've had the opportunity to work with Elizabeth a couple times now. I attended her flower arrangement class back in February and had the best time and was able to take a few new tricks home when it came to creating and taking care of my arrangement. Additionally, I used Elizabethâ€™s services for a small family event and she created the most beautiful blue, white and green whimsical arrangements just like I imagined! She took my very loose inspiration photos for color and vibe and was able to ask me a few questions to get a good idea of what I was looking for (even though I didn't even really know what I wanted) and they turned out perfectly! And even though this was a smaller event, nothing to the scale of the weddings she does, she was so professional, detail-oriented and took great care of us. She went above and beyond! I would highly recommend working with Elizabeth.</p>

                                <p>I am a Wedding Planner and have worked with Elizabeth on several projects. Not only is she knowledgeable about florals, she is also a beautiful designer and great Partner! She really listens to the client's vision, is open to feedback/input from me, and tailors her proposals and designs to meet the client's needs. I highly recommend Elizabeth Rose Florals if you are looking for a florist (wedding or otherwise)!</p>
